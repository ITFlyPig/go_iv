Release checklist

This is a checklist of things to do, to complete a sucessful release.
This is only relevant to the people who intend to release signed apks to github and google play - if you're just
cloning the project or you're making your own version, this doesn't apply to you.

1. Update the version code in build.gradle, and the version name.
2. Ensure that all changes are on master
3. Ensure that the machine building the release APKs has fabric keys
4. Generate a signed APK for the offline and an online github variant using the github keystore
5. Generate a signed APK for the playstore variant using the playstore keystore
6. Rename the github variant "GoIV-Offline.x.x.x.apk" and "GoIV-Online.x.x.x.apk" (The naming needs to be exact, it's used by the github auto update feature)
7. Write a changelog
8. Upload the offline & online release to github, and paste in the changelog.
9. Upload the playstore variant to google play, and paste in the changelog.
10. Create a release thread for discussion on reddit. The update thread should include the changelog, download links, and any announcement.
11. Update the download links for the apk in the reddit sidebar.
